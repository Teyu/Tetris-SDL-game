# A Tetris SDL-game

This is a remake of the classic tetris game in progress.

This project serves for me to improve my c++ skills, learn cross-platform programming with cmake, 
as well as putting in audio and animations. First of all I want to improve my skills (I am a newbie) and hopefully the result will
be a game that everyone is welcome to play and to just have fun with it :-)
